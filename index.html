<div id="col ">
<p class="margin">Microsoft’s Verdana typeface family consists of four TrueType fonts created specifically 
to address the challenges of on-screen display. Designed by world renowned type designer 
Matthew Carter, and hand-hinted by leading hinting expert, Monotype’s Tom Rickner, these 
sans serif fonts are unique examples of type design for the computer screen.</p>

<p class="margin">In 2008, during their merger with Northwest Airlines and resulting rebranding effort, 
Delta Air Lines changed their official logo typeface from Times New Roman to Verdana. In 
2009, IKEA changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a 
desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been 
attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography.
Time magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a 
brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and 
designers.</p>

<p class="margin">In 2008, during their merger with Northwest Airlines and resulting rebranding effort, 
Delta Air Lines changed their official logo typeface from Times New Roman to Verdana. In 
2009, IKEA changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a 
desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been 
attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography.
Time magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a 
brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and 
designers. Design and advertising industry-focused publications such as Business Week 
joined the fray of online posts. The branding critic blog Brand New was one of those using 
the Verdanagate name.The Australian online daily news site Crikey also published an 
article on the controversy. The Guardian ran an article asking "Ikea is changing its 
font to Verdana – causing outrage among typomaniacs. Should the rest of us care? Absolutely.
"The New York Times said the change to Verdana "is so offensive to many because it seems
like a slap at the principles of design by a company that has been hailed for its adherence
to them."

<!-- <h4 class="margin">Matthew Carter</h4> -->
<p class="margin">Designer Matthew Carter is attributed with creating the typeface Verdana
in the year 1996. The typeface was requisitioned by Microsoft in accordance with the realization
that such a web safe font was needed for the times. However before even creating Verdana
Carter already had a platform to stand on due to the success of his father Harry Carter a 
book designer and historian of printing. This legacy from his father granted him the opportunity
to hold an internship at the Joh. Enschedé type foundry where he was trained in the now rare
art of manual punchcutting. Later in his life once finished with training Carter became a
freelancer in London where he managed to cut his own version of the semi-bold typeface Dante.</p>

<p>During the course of his career Carter earned numerous awards for his impact and contribution
to typography and design. To name some of his awards he has received a honoris causa, Doctorate
of Humane Letters from The Art Institute of Boston and an AIGA medal. He has also been named
a MacArthur Foundation Fellow and is currently a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale.</p>

<p>Other typefaces attributed to Carter aside from Verdana include Alisal, Bell Centenial,
Big Caslon, Big Figgins, Big Moore, Carter Sans, Cascade Script, Charter, Cochin, Elephant,
Fenway, ITC Galliard, Gando, Georgia, Helvetica Compressed, Helvetica Greek, Mantinia, Meiryo,
Miller, Monticello, Nina, Olympian, Rocky, Roster, Shelley Script, Sitka, Snell Roundhand, Skia,
Sophia, Stilson, Tahoma, Van Lanen, Vincent, Walker, Wilson Greek, and Yale.</p>
