<div id="col ">
<p class="margin">Microsoft’s Verdana typeface family consists of four TrueType fonts created specifically 
to address the challenges of on-screen display. Designed by world renowned type designer 
Matthew Carter, and hand-hinted by leading hinting expert, Monotype’s Tom Rickner, these 
sans serif fonts are unique examples of type design for the computer screen.</p>

<p class="margin">In 2008, during their merger with Northwest Airlines and resulting rebranding effort, 
Delta Air Lines changed their official logo typeface from Times New Roman to Verdana. In 
2009, IKEA changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a 
desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been 
attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography.
Time magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a 
brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and 
designers.</p>

<p class="margin">In 2008, during their merger with Northwest Airlines and resulting rebranding effort, 
Delta Air Lines changed their official logo typeface from Times New Roman to Verdana. In 
2009, IKEA changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a 
desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been 
attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography.
Time magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a 
brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and 
designers. Design and advertising industry-focused publications such as Business Week 
joined the fray of online posts. The branding critic blog Brand New was one of those using 
the Verdanagate name.The Australian online daily news site Crikey also published an 
article on the controversy. The Guardian ran an article asking "Ikea is changing its 
font to Verdana – causing outrage among typomaniacs. Should the rest of us care? Absolutely.
"The New York Times said the change to Verdana "is so offensive to many because it seems
like a slap at the principles of design by a company that has been hailed for its adherence
to them." Speaking about the topic in 2013, Carter said "Ever since there was that big 
ruckus about the IKEA catalog changing from Futura to Verdana, which I had nothing to do 
with and didn’t even know about, people ask me about that everywhere I go. I give a talk 
about something historical and then at the end someone will get up and say: “I started a 
petition to go back to Futura. You’re a villain!” You get blamed for something you had 
nothing to do with. There’s a strange misunderstanding. A friendly guy came up to me at a 
conference recently and said: I signed that petition to go back to Futura. So I asked: 
what caused you to do that? And he said, well, Verdana is a screen font. You mustn’t use 
it in print. So I said: OK, well, so you open the IKEA catalog, it’s set in Verdana, with 
the big prices and everything… how do you tell it’s a screen font? What is it about Verdana 
that says: this is a screen font? He had no idea. He just knew it because he’d been told. 
There are many people who make judgments without really understanding what the typographic 
issues are. Students are interesting — they’ll say things to me like: my professor told me 
I cannot use Verdana and Georgia in print because they’re screen fonts, but I tried it and 
it looks perfectly all right. And I can only say: 'Thank you! Go ahead!'"

<h4 class="margin">Matthew Carter</h4>
<p class="margin">People with famous parents start life with a handicap. It becomes a serious handicap if 
the parents are famous in a field in which the child would like to make its own way. Matthew 
Carter started with a very serious handicap, for his father, Harry Carter, was both a great 
scholar in the world of type and printing, and a type designer of extraordinary skill. His 
Cyrillic Baskerville, for example, will always be a model of grace and scholarship to 
anybody who has tried to learn what should be known about cyrillic alphabets. It is said 
that Harry Carter learned Dutch on the boat from Harwich to Hook of Holland, and Hebrew 
making his way to Palestine in a variety of planes and boats during the second World War. 
What is galling to those of us whose grasp on other European languages is almost cursory 
is that Matthew seems to have the same easy facility. What is not galling to those of us 
who also have drawn typefaces for various 'imaging media' (in the kind of vocabulary that 
finds its way onto the Web) is the breathtaking skill that he shows in making type that 
works wherever it was meant to work. We first met at the time he was drawing a sanserif 
face called Airport for signage at Heathrow, and was also mixed up in making Meridien at 
Crosfield, where a spinning disc was the negative carrier. In due course he went to Brooklyn 
where he started drawing faces for Mergenthaler, usually filling some urgent need that 
seemed important at the time. Almost lost among this work was a considerable administrative 
ability, largely because it was so often used in propping up the lack of it among some of 
his colleagues. Perhaps it was not until the formation of Bitstream, of which he was one 
of the four founders, that he became really well known to other than his peers. Bitstream 
became the darling of Seybold, and he and Mike Parker earned permanent places on every 
platform in the industry. But it was before these years, when they were both still at 
Linotype, that Snell Roundhand first appeared. Then, as Adobe and Macintosh were beginning 
to dominate the design industry, this was soon followed by Galliard, which became almost 
immediately the typeface in which everything was set, including the Seybold report itself. 
In all Matthew admits to having designed 23 faces, and some of these are families. Many of 
these faces were, as so many must be and are, largely derivative, being based on writing 
books or metal faces from a previous age. It has been with faces like Bell Centennial that 
we have seen designs from Matthew Carter that owe little to any ideas except his own. 
Charter was made to work in a low resolution laser printing environment. There was also 
the set of screen fonts called Interchange. But the projects that have occupied so much of
this year have been to make designs that can gradually become more subtle as the resolution
for which they are hinted increases. There has perhaps been no font family designed before
these that has made such full use of the powerful capabilities of TrueType hinting. Thus
what you see here is the elegant but simple form made for the screen. Printed out on 
paper the letterforms have become more complex and more legible.</p>
