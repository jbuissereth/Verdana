<h1>History</h1>
<p>On January 1, 49 BC, the Roman Senate issued a final order for Julius Caesar to disband
his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished. In response, Caesar 
led a single legion, the Thirteenth Legion, over the Rubicon river (the frontier boundary 
of his Gaulish provinces to centrally administered Roman Italy). This action, in igniting 
Caesar's civil war, was a significant event in the eventual creation of the Roman Empire.
On October 26, 1597 (September 13th in the Korean lunisolar calendar), Korean Admiral Yi 
Sun-Sin defeated a 133 warship strong Japanese naval invasion force with the last 13 ships 
of the Joseon navy, at the Battle of Myeongnyang. Being a decisive Joseon victory in the 
Myeongnyang Strait, there were no losses of any Korean ships. Later dying in the final 
battle of the Imjin War, Admiral Yi Sun-Sin completed his 23 battle career undefeated in 
combat. The surprise halt of the Japanese invasion led to a lengthy stalemate and withdrawal 
of the Japanese Armies from Korea, and serves as a historic foundation for Korean nationalism.
The United States of America was created from thirteen British colonies and as such, the 
number thirteen is a commonly recurring motif in American heraldry. For example, there are 
thirteen stars on the Great Seal of the United States and there are thirteen stripes on the 
American flag.The first flag of the United States bore thirteen stripes, alternating red 
and white, and thirteen white stars in the blue union. The thirteen stripes represented 
the Thirteen Colonies from which the United States was created, and the thirteen stars 
represented the number of states in the new nation. When two new states were added to the 
Union in 1795, the flag bore fifteen stars and fifteen stripes. With the addition of five 
new states in 1818, the number of stripes was re-set and permanently fixed at thirteen.
The Great Seal of the United States bears many images of the number thirteen, representing 
the Thirteen Colonies from which the United States was created. On the Seal’s observe, the 
overhead glory bears thirteen stars. The chest shield in front of the spread eagle bears 
thirteen stripes (seven white and six red). In the eagle’s right talon, it holds the Olive 
Branch of Peace, bearing thirteen olives and thirteen olive leaves. In the eagle’s left 
talon, it holds the Weapons of War, consisting of thirteen arrows. In the eagle’s mouth, 
it holds a scroll bearing the national motto “E Pluribus Unum” (which, by coincidence, 
consists of thirteen letters). On the Seal’s reverse, the unfinished pyramid consists of 
thirteen levels. Apollo 13 was a NASA Moon mission famous for being a "successful failure" 
in 1970.</p>

<h1>Religion</h1>
<p>
In Roman Catholicism the apparitions of the Virgin of Fátima in 1917 were claimed to occur 
on the 13th day of six consecutive months. In Catholic devotional practice, the number 
thirteen is also associated with Saint Anthony of Padua, since his feast day falls on June 
13. A traditional devotion called the Thirteen Tuesdays of St. Anthony[8] involves praying 
to the saint every Tuesday over a period of thirteen weeks. Another devotion, St. Anthony's 
Chaplet, consists of thirteen decades of three beads each. As for Sikhism, according to 
famous Sakhi (Evidence) or story of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, when he was an accountant at a town 
of Sultanpur Lodhi, he was distributing groceries to people. When he gave groceries to the 
13th person, he stopped because in Gurmukhi and Hindi the word 13 is called Terah, which 
means yours. And Guru Nanak Dev Ji kept saying, "Yours, yours, yours..." remembering God. 
People reported to the emperor that Guru Nanak Dev Ji was giving out free food to the people. 
When treasures were checked, there was more money than before. The Vaisakhi, which commemorates
the creation of "Khalsa" or pure Sikh was celebrated on April 13 for many years. In Judaism, 
13 signifies the age at which a boy matures and becomes a Bar Mitzvah. The number of 
principles of Jewish faith according to Maimonides. According to Rabbinic commentary on the 
Torah, God has 13 Attributes of Mercy. The number 13 had been considered sinister and wicked 
in ancient Iranian (Persian) civilization and Zoroastrianism. Since beginning of the Nourooz 
tradition, the 13th day of each new Iranian year is called Sizdah Be-dar, and this tradition 
is still alive among Iranian people both within Iran and abroad. Since Sizdah Be-dar is the 
13th day of the year, it is considered a day when evil's power might cause difficulties for 
people. Therefore, people leave urban areas for one day and camp in the countryside. Even 
in the current post-1979 Revolution era, and despite the wishes of Islamic government, this 
tradition continues to be practiced by the majority of the population throughout Iran. In 
Shia Islam, 13 signifies the 13th day of the month of Rajab (the Lunar calendar), which is 
the birth of Imam Ali. 13 also is a total of 1 Prophet and 12 Imams in the Islamic School 
of Thought. However, in Sunni Islam, the number 13 bears no symbolic significance. In Wicca, 
most covens have 13 members, although sometimes there can be fewer.</p>

<h1>Superstition</h1>
<p>The number 13 is considered an unlucky number in some countries. The end of the Mayan 
calendar's 13th Baktun was superstitiously feared as a harbinger of the apocalyptic 2012 
phenomenon. Fear of the number 13 has a specifically recognized phobia, Triskaidekaphobia, 
a word coined in 1911. The superstitious sufferers of triskaidekaphobia try to avoid bad 
luck by keeping away from anything numbered or labelled thirteen. As a result, companies 
and manufacturers use another way of numbering or labelling to avoid the number, with 
hotels and tall buildings being conspicuous examples (thirteenth floor). It's also considered 
unlucky to have thirteen guests at a table. Friday the 13th has been considered an unlucky day. 
There are a number of theories as to why the number thirteen became associated with bad luck, 
but none of them have been accepted as likely. The Last Supper: At Jesus Christ's last supper, 
there were thirteen people around the table, counting Christ and the twelve apostles. Some 
believe this is unlucky because one of those thirteen, Judas Iscariot, was the betrayer of 
Jesus Christ. From the 1890s, a number of English language sources relate the "unlucky" 
thirteen to an idea that at the Last Supper, Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was the 
13th to sit at the table. Knights Templar: On Friday 13 October 1307, King Philip IV of France 
ordered the arrest of the Knights Templar, and most of the knights were tortured and 
killed. Full Moons: A year with 13 full moons instead of 12 posed problems for the monks in 
charge of the calendars. "This was considered a very unfortunate circumstance, especially 
by the monks who had charge of the calendar of thirteen months for that year, and it upset 
the regular arrangement of church festivals. For this reason thirteen came to be considered 
an unlucky number." However, a typical century has about 37 years that have 13 full 
moons, compared to 63 years with 12 full moons, and typically every third or fourth year 
has 13 full moons. A Repressed Lunar Cult: In ancient cultures, the number 13 represented 
femininity, because it corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year 
(13 x 28 = 364 days). The theory is that, as the solar calendar triumphed over the lunar, 
the number thirteen became anathema. Hammurabi's Code: There is a myth that the earliest 
reference to thirteen being unlucky or evil is in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi 
(circa 1780 BC), where the thirteenth law is said to be omitted. In fact, the original 
Code of Hammurabi has no numeration. The translation by L.W. King (1910), edited by Richard 
Hooker, omitted one article: If the seller have gone to (his) fate (i. e., have died), 
the purchaser shall recover damages in said case fivefold from the estate of the seller. 
Other translations of the Code of Hammurabi, for example the translation by Robert Francis 
Harper, include the 13th article.</p>
